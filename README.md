# MIPS-simulator

There are three files- java code, input file(fib.bin) and a corresponding sample output file(out.txt).
This code takes binary file as an input.
Also, you need to pass the input_file_name and output_file_name as the command line arguments.
Run by using following commands:
  
  javac MIPSsim.java
  
  java MIPSsim fib.bin out.txt
